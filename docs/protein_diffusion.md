## We've got another slide right here
### with mafs

$$a^2 + 55 / 45 = \delta$$

---

Explain it like I'm 5

Diffusion models make thing similar to what they were trained on.
Examples with images
- Dall-e
- Stable Diffusion
- IMAGEN

---

Explain it like I'm 15
Train a diffusion model like this.
Images and prompts represented as numbers
Latent representation
Gradually add noise
Train to recover image

---

Explain it like I'm 30

Latent representation
Add noise
Train to recover original numbers

---

Explain it like I'm 15

Proteins represented as numbers
- sequence
- angles
- binding whatnot
Add noise
Train to recover original proteins

maybe one slide for each of the protein papers
